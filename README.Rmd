## How MaMi.CoDi Works

### The Basilar Membrane

When a chord is sounded, pressure waves travel through the air. Those pressure
waves enter the ear canal where they vibrate the ear drum. The ear drum transfers
the energy of the pressure waves through a series of bones in the fluid of the 
middle ear to an oval window on the shell-shaped cochlea of the inner ear. 
Within the fluid of the cochlea, the sound energy is converted into a traveling 
surface wave along the basilar membrane.\

Human basilar membranes are around 33 mm long. Thousands of evenly-spaced hair 
cells are arranged in a line on the basilar membrane. The hair cells transduce
mechanical vibrations into electrical activity that is sent along the auditory 
nerve to the central auditory system. When a sound wave travels along the basilar 
membrane, the hair cells positioned near the wavelength of that sound will send 
electrical activity along the auditory nerve.\

Consider, though, that the fundamental tone of middle C is 1.31 meters long. 
The basilar membrane is only 33mm long. 
How can the hair cells of the inner ear detect wavelengths that are
longer than the basilar membrane?\

The traveling sound waves shorten as they travel around the spiral
cochlea. Middle C's fundamental wavelength of 1.31 meters in air shrinks to 
26 mm along the basilar membrane. So, when the fundamental tone of middle C is 
sounded, the hair cells positioned 26 mm (81%) from the base of the cochlea
send electrical activity along the auditory nerve.\

When a musical chord comprised of many fundamental tones and harmonics is sounded,
the hair cells at each shortened wavelength position send signals along 
the auditory nerve. This spatial or rate-place arrangement of hair cell positions and 
wavelengths of tones is known as tonotopy.\

### The Core Idea of MaMi.CoDi

If we play a chord, freeze time and observe which hair cells are displaced, what 
are we observing? Are we observing frequencies? Periods? No. Time is frozen.
Frequency (1/s) and period (s) are temporal observations. We are making a purely 
spatial observation about wavelengths (m). We will come back to temporal
observations shortly.\

When we combine all the component parts of a chord together into a whole, 
we can estimate the overall wavelength for the whole chord. A technique used in digital signal 
processing and bricklaying is to estimate ratios (within an acceptable tolerance)
between each of the parts and a selected reference part.
The least common denominator (LCD) of those part ratios will be a measure of the periodicity 
of the whole relative to the selected reference part.\

The overall chord wavelength will be as long as
or longer than the longest component wavelength of the chord. Chords with short 
wavelengths relative to the component wavelengths sound pleasant. And chords 
with long wavelengths relative to component wavelengthsound unpleasant. 
MaMi.CoDi uses this measure of relative wavelength to predict the 
perceived spatial consonance of a chord.\

Let us unfreeze time and start counting how often a hair cell moves due to a 
pure tone of our sounded chord. If we count the number of movements relative to a
certain amount of time, we will be observing the frequency of the partial. 
This would be a temporal observation. The auditory system has a property called 
phase locking which allows it to encode the time intervals, periods, between spikes from 
sound waves.\

When we combine the period components of a chord together, we can estimate 
the overall period for the whole chord. That chord period will be as long as
or longer than the longest component period of the chord. Short relative periods
sound pleasant. Long relative periods sound unpleasant.
MaMi.CoDi uses this measure of chord period to predict the perceived temporal 
consonance of a chord.\

MaMi.CoDi sums the spatial and temporal consonance predictions to create
an overall consonance-dissonance prediction. MaMi.CoDi subtracts
the spatial consonance from the temporal consonance to create a major-minor polarity 
prediction. Positive values will sound major, negative values minor and values 
around zero will sound neutral.\

Because wavelength and frequency are inverse of each other one might imagine that 
the spatial and temporal signals would have the same values. However, for complex 
pitches that is not the case. The pattern of the two sets of components are different.
See the example of the major triad with 5 harmonics, below.

```{r, child=c('man/Spatiotemporal_Periodicity.Rmd')}
```

### Finding the Tolerance Values

MaMi.CoDi uses the Stern-Brocot tree to find rational fractions for the ratios 
within a given tolerance. How do we find the best tolerance values? For the 
MaMi.CoDi model we ran thousands of computations with various tolerance values 
and compared the predictions with results from six of the large-scale behavioral 
experiments.\

Because the spatial signal and the temporal signal have different origins
we initially did a two-dimensional tolerance search. However the closest 
fits to the behavioral data came from spatial and tolerance values being the 
same. Insofar as this model represents processing in the auditory cortex, it 
would seem that estimating the cyclicity of the two signals happens higher up
in the auditoray system after the spatial and temporal signals have been processed.\
 
## Theoretical predictions compared to large-scale behavioral results

The large-scale behavioral data in the plots below are from [Timbral effects on consonance disentangle psychoacoustic mechanisms and suggest perceptual origins for musical scales](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45812-z) by Raja Marjieh, Peter M. C. Harrison, Harin Lee, Fotini Deligiannaki & Nori Jacoby.

#### Notes on plots:

In the plots above:

* The cream lines are smoothed experimental data from Marjieh, Harrison et al.

* The multi-colored points are MaMi.CoDi computational predictions

* The multi-colored lines are smoothed MaMi.CoDi computational predictions

* The colors represent MaMi.CoDi computational predictions for major-minor polarity:
* Gold is major
* Red is neutral
* Blue is minor

* The vertical axis is z-scored consonance-dissonance

* The horizontal axis is the width of the dyad from 0 to 15 semitones
* For example, the data at 4 represents the equal tempered major third, M3
* While the data at 8 represents the equal tempered minor sixth, m6
