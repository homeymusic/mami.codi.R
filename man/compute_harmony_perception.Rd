\title{Compute harmony perception from cycle lengths}
\usage{
compute_harmony_perception(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Cycle lengths for the fundamental frequency and fundamental wavelength.}
}
\value{
Overall dissonance and major-minor tonality perception.
}
\description{
Computes harmony perception metrics based on cycle lengths from the spatial
and temporal frequency domains, converting them into psychophysical measures
of dissonance perception. The sum of wavelength dissonance and frequency
dissonance provides an overall sense of dissonance, while the difference
indicates major-minor tonality.
