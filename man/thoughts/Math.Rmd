### The Math

#### The Fundamentals

    * A series of tones is sounded for an infinite amount of time.
    * The state of a tone ratio is described by a Stern-Brocot (SB) function 
    which is the probability of the tone ratio's rational fraction approximation.
        * Tone ratios are quantized.
        * The SB distribution has variance $\sigma^2$.
        * The integral of the SB probability distribution is 1.
    * The fundamental tone of a series of tones is the ALCD of the ratios of 
    the series relative to the minimum tone. 
    * There are two series of tone ratios for each series of sounded tones.
        * Wavelength ratios
        * Frequency ratios
    * Wavelength and frequency ??? (ratios, fundamentals, values?) are conjugates.
    * The variances of the wavelength and frequency variance are governed by 
    the generalized uncertainty principle.

#### Stern Brocot

Consonance perception of a chord with multiple partials is both a wave and a 
probabilistic phenomenon.

The probabilistic aspect comes from approximating rational numbers within a given 
variance using the Stern-Brocot tree.

#### Free Wave Packets

$$\psi(x,t) = e^{-i \left( \pmb{\omega} t - \pmb{k} x \right) }$$

$$\phi(\pmb{k})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int e^{-i \pmb{k} \pmb{\omega}}\psi(\pmb{\omega})d^N \omega $$

$\pmb{\omega}$ and $\pmb{k}$ are vectors of length $N$.

#### Fourier Transform

$$\psi(\pmb{\omega})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int e^{i \pmb{k} \pmb{\omega}}\phi(\pmb{k})d^N k$$

$$\phi(\pmb{k})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int e^{-i \pmb{k} \pmb{\omega}}\psi(\pmb{\omega})d^N \omega $$

$\pmb{\omega}$ and $\pmb{k}$ are vectors of length $N$.

#### Now Make $\psi$ and $\phi$ work

$\psi$ is temporal, the probability of the fundamental frequency.\

$\phi$ is spatial, the probability of the fundamental wavelength.\



#### Real Traveling Wave


$$\psi(x,t) = \sin \left( \frac{2\pi x}{\lambda_{0}} - 2 \pi f_{0} t \right)$$

#### Complex Traveling Wave

$$\psi(x,t) = e ^ {-i\left( 2 \pi f_{0} t - \frac{2\pi x}{\lambda_{0}} \right)}$$

#### State of the Chord

At time $t$ the probability for the chord to be in a given state is given by

$$dP(x) = |\psi(x,t)|^2dx$$
It's a probability so the integral must be one:

$$P(x)=\int|\psi(x,t)|^2dx=1 $$

### Thoughts

$f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both probabilities. The product of their variance satisfies
the uncertainty principle.\

So what are they in our model?\

$f_{0}(f_{i \dots N})$ and $\lambda_{0}(\lambda_{i \dots N})$ are probabilities 
that a set of frequencies or wavelengths will have a specific fundamental value.\
