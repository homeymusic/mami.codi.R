“sub specie aeternitatis” p 431  

The above makes me think of the contrast between the infinity of Fourier
versus me with my ruler in one hand, stopwatch in the other and a tally
counter around my neck.  

The conventional language is a blocker for me. When time is frozen and
we measure the wavelength in the cochlea that is a purely spatial
observation. But the convention is to call that a frequency measured in
Hz, which is 1/s. But time is frozen. There are no seconds? What
gives?  

Can we abandon the label of time-frequency domain and replace it with
space-time domain?  

But this can be a problem too:  

    #> # A tibble: 4 × 2
    #>   space          time           
    #>   <chr>          <chr>          
    #> 1 spatial length temporal length
    #> 2 wavelength     period         
    #> 3 count in space count in time  
    #> 4 wavenumber     frequency

Gabor’s model starts with the orthogonal sine and cosine functions. And
uses the set of those 2 coefficients to create a data set of size
2(f2-f1)tau.  

MaMi.CoDi starts with the wavelength (row of hair cells, bank of reeds)
and frequency (phase-locking, oscillograph) signals to create a data set
of size 2(f2-f1)tau.
