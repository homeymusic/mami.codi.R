Gabor
================

The dimensions of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle (HUP) are a purely
period dimension, position (s) measured in meters, and a
spatio-frequency mass dimension, momentum (p) measured in kg \* m / s.  

The dimensions of Gabor’s application of HUP to signal analysis are a
frequency dimension, time of the signal (t) measured in seconds, and
another frequency dimension, frequency of the signal (f), measured in 1 /
seconds.  

The dimensions of MaMi.CoDis application of HUP to signal analysis are
a  
period dimension, period (l) measured in meters, and a frequency
dimension, frequency (f) measured in 1 / seconds.

“sub specie aeternitatis” p 431  

The above makes me think of the contrast between the infinity of Fourier
versus me with my ruler in one hand, stopwatch in the other and a tally
counter around my neck.  

“We know that any instrument, or combination of instruments, cannot
obtain more than at most 2(f2 — f1)tau independent data from the area
(f2 — f1)tau in the diagram. But instead of rigorously independent data,
which can be obtained in general only by calculation from the instrument
readings, it will be more convenient for the moment to
consider”practically” independent data, which can be obtained by direct
readings.” -Gabor  

“Decay time x Tuning width = Number of the order one.”  

For MaMi.CoDi:  

Wavelength ratio variance x Frequency ratio variance = Number of the
order one  

One observation happens in a “characteristic rectangle” in the
space-time diagram.

The conventional language is a blocker for me. When time is frozen and
we measure the period in the cochlea that is a purely period
observation. But the convention is to label that a frequency measured in
Hz, which is 1/s. But time is frozen. There are no seconds? What
gives?  

It should be a period length measured in meters. Can we abandon the
label of time-frequency domain and replace it with space-time domain?  

But this can be a problem too:  

    #> # A tibble: 4 × 2
    #>   space          time           
    #>   <chr>          <chr>          
    #> 1 period length frequency length

    #> 3 count in space count in time

    #> 1  262. 2616. 0.00382       9.00

Gabor’s model starts with the orthogonal sine and cosine functions. And
uses the set of those 2 coefficients to create a data set of size
2(f2-f1)tau.  

MaMi.CoDi starts with the period (row of hair cells, bank of reeds)
and frequency (phase-locking, oscillograph) signals to create a data set
of size 2(f2-f1)tau.
