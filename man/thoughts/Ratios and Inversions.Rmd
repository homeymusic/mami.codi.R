# Why is MaMi.CoDi's wavelength tolerance twice the frequency tolerance?\

Is it related to the octave complement formula?\

Octave-complement intervals represented as ratios r follow the relation r1 r2 = 2. For given r the unknown x can be calculated by the formula x := 2/r or (for the ratio representation r = a/b) into x := 2 (b / a).\

The result sometimes has to be reduced by the factor 2.\

Examples\
5/4 vs. 2*4/5 = 8/5\
4/3 vs. 2*3/4 = 6/4 = 3/2\

# The wavelength and frequency ratio

l = s / f\
 
where l is wavelength, f is frequency and s is the speed of sound.\

but what about ratios?\

f_64 / f_60

```{r, echo=F, results='asis', message=F}
devtools::load_all(".")
t = tibble::tibble(
  f_64                 = hrep::midi_to_freq(64),
  l_64                 = SPEED_OF_SOUND / f_64,
  f_60                 = hrep::midi_to_freq(60),
  l_60                 = SPEED_OF_SOUND / f_60,
  major_third_fr       = f_64  / f_60,
  major_third_fr_fract = list(rational_fraction(t$major_third_fr, default_tolerance('macro'))),
  major_third_lr       = l_64  / l_60,
  major_third_fr_inv   = 1  / major_third_fr,
  major_third_lr_inv   = 1  / major_third_lr,
